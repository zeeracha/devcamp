        I am Ratchadaporn Charoenphol. You can call me Zeera, I am 25 years old. I graduated from Assumption University in BBA faculty, major marketing. Since I graduated i never find the job, so I don't have any experience about that. I felt intersted about the programming after last year because I try to find the work that I can do at home. After that I i ststared to entering the programming online course, but may be I study alone that make me burn out. Finally I give up at that time. Unfortunately, I met DEVCODE after it strated just 2 days and I think It might be good opportunity to participate this course. SO I JOINED IT.
