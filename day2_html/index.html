      I walked through the door with you. The air was cold but something about it felt like home somehow And I left my scarf there at your sister's house 
      nd you've still got it in your drawer even now. oh, your sweet disposition And my wide-eyed gaze We're singing in the car,
      getting lost upstate Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place And I can picture it after all these days.
      And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
      'Cause there we are again on that little town street You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me Wind in my hair, 
      I was there I remember it all too well
